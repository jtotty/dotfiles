# James's Dotfiles

This repository contains my own personal config files. These include configs, customizations, themes, and whatever else I use to personalize my Linux and Windows Powershell experience.

> ⚠️ These may not always be up-to-date or some settings my differ from your our own personal environment.

## Terminal and App Icons
I use [Nerd-Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com) to display custom icons in my "Oh-My-Zsh" and "Oh-My-Posh" theme. I personally use `JetBrains Mono Nerd Font`.

## WSL2 Ubuntu
I use [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki) as my shell with the specified nerd font above. In combination with zsh I also use the
theme [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

Config files can be found in the `ubuntu` directory.

## Windows 11
I use [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.3) with [Oh-My-Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/) as my shell
with the specified font above.

I have my own custom "Oh-My-Posh" theme setup which can be found in the `powershell` directory.

I also use [Terminal Icons](https://github.com/devblackops/Terminal-Icons) specifically for powershell.
