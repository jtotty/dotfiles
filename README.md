# My dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfile configuration. This not only acts as a backup but also allows easy set-up across multiple devices.

I manage my configuration files using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). This allows me to easily set-up symlinc for all my files.

## Terminal and App Icons
[Nerd-Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com) to display custom icons for "Oh-My-Zsh" and Neovim. I use `JetBrains Mono Nerd Font` at the moment.

## WSL2 Ubuntu for Windows 11
My development environment is setup in WSL2 for Windows 11 running the Linux Ubuntu 22.4 distro. I use [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki) as my shell with the specified nerd font above.
