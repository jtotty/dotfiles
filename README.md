# My dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfile configuration. This not only acts as a backup but also allows easy set-up across multiple devices.

I sync my configuration files using across devices using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

## Font and Icons
Using [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) which are patched versions of popular programming fonts that include extra glyphs (icons) for use in terminals.

Current favourite: `Geist Mono Nerd Font` - [Link to original](https://vercel.com/font)

Sometimes `Jet Brains Mono Nerd Font` - [Link to original](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
